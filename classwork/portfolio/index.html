                    <p>My name is Collin Krueger, and I absolutely love tabletop games. I have been making games since I was a kid, creating the fun experiences at sleepovers and playdates. I have always found joy in setting up an experience for someone else to have fun. Tabletop games gave me a chance to share my love for gamecraft with others.</p>
                    <p>Before I even knew what was out there, I would create interactive stories for my friends to play through based on my love of choose your own adventure books as a kid. Eventually, I created a tabletop system from scratch at 14 based on my favorite game at the time, Fallout: New Vegas, creating a world based on a post-apocalyptic vision of my hometown, Chicago. The game was clunky, and as I got people to start coming together, I was introduced to Dungeons & Dragons. I instantly fell in love, realized that other people had been doing for decades the experience I could never quite find. I incorporated some aspects into my project, and after that campaign concluded, I switched my friends to Dungeons & Dragons.</p>
                    <p>I continued developing, reading and running others games: Pathfinder, Fate, Dread, Vampire: The Masquerade, and many, many more, taking inspiration from the different systems which make up the tabletop games genre, and decided to take my own shot at creating a system.</p>
